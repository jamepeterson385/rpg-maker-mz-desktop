# Rpg Maker Mz Desktop

*Dated copies of Rpg Maker Mz data data, nothing uploaded.*

## About

**Rpg Maker Mz Desktop** is a desktop helper. A desktop helper that finds Rpg Maker Mz data directories and archives config and export files locally.

Rpg Maker Mz config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## Editions

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Highlights

- Maps Rpg Maker Mz data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## The problem

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
